## Setting Up Your Environment ‚öôÔ∏è

Before you start coding, let‚Äôs get your machine ready. Follow these steps, and don‚Äôt skip the virtual environment part unless you *love* error messages. üòè

1. **Clone the Repo** üì•
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vezz-z/customer-churn-dashboard.git
   cd customer-churn-dashboard
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment** üèóÔ∏è
   - Run our fancy batch file (Windows only, sorry Linux/Mac folks):
     ```bash
     .\venv_creator.bat
     ```
   - Choose `y` to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`. If `venv/` exists, pick `b` to update packages or `a` to nuke it and start fresh.
   - **Linux/Mac?** Create a virtual environment manually:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Test the App** üöÄ
   - Launch the server:
     ```bash
     .\webpage_server_host_runner.bat
     ```
     Or, for Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     python app.py
     ```
   - Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser. If it doesn‚Äôt open, check `app.log` or `%TEMP%\app_output.txt` for clues.

4. **Verify It Works** ‚úÖ
   - Upload a sample dataset (`Sample_dataset1.csv`) and play with the dashboard. If charts load and the chatbot sasses you back, you‚Äôre golden!

## Code Style Guidelines üìè

Let‚Äôs keep this codebase cleaner than a freshly uploaded CSV! üßπ Follow these rules to make your code sparkle and avoid a lecture from our sassy chatbot. üòà We want contributions that fit seamlessly into our churn-fighting masterpiece, so stick to these guidelines for Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and general awesomeness. Your code‚Äôs gonna shine brighter than our dashboard‚Äôs dark theme! üåü

### Python (app.py) üêç
Our Flask backend is the brain of the operation, so keep it sharp and PEP 8-compliant. No one wants to debug a mess that looks like it was written by a caffeinated squirrel.

- **Follow PEP 8**: Stick to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) like it‚Äôs your life‚Äôs mission. Run `pylint` or `flake8` if you‚Äôre feeling fancy.
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces. Tabs? We don‚Äôt speak that language.
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 88 characters (Black‚Äôs default). Wrap long lines like a pro.
- **Docstrings**: Every function needs a docstring. Make it clear, not a novel.
  ```python
  def clean_data(df):
      """Cleans the dataframe like a data janitor. Returns a shiny dataset."""
      pass
  ```
- **Variable Names**: Be descriptive. Use `churn_rate`, not `cr`. Snake_case for variables, CamelCase for classes.
- **Imports**: Group imports: standard library, third-party, then local. One per line.
  ```python
  import os
  import pandas as pd
  from flask import Flask
  ```
- **Error Handling**: Catch specific exceptions, not a vague `except:`. Log errors to `app.log`.
  ```python
  try:
      df = pd.read_csv(file)
  except FileNotFoundError:
      logging.error("CSV file went AWOL!")
  ```
- **Functions**: Keep them short (under 30 lines if possible). One function, one job.
- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what*. Use `#` sparingly.
  ```python
  # Calculate churn rate because stakeholders love percentages
  churn_rate = df["churn"].mean()
  ```

### JavaScript (script.js) üíª
Our frontend JS handles the dashboard‚Äôs magic, from AJAX calls to chatbot sass. Keep it tidy, or we‚Äôll make you debug jQuery in the dark.

- **CamelCase**: Functions and variables use camelCase (e.g., `sendChatMessage`, `currentRevenue`).
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces. No tabs, unless you want a stern talking-to.
- **Line Length**: Aim for 80 characters. Break long lines for readability.
- **Comments**: Use `//` for single lines, `/* */` for blocks. Explain complex logic.
  ```javascript
  // Don‚Äôt ask why this AJAX call works, just trust me
  $.ajax({ ... });
  ```
- **Functions**: Keep them focused (under 20 lines). Use arrow functions for callbacks.
  ```javascript
  const updateCharts = () => {
      // Update those fancy charts
  };
  ```
- **Async/Await**: Prefer `async/await` over `.then()` for AJAX calls.
  ```javascript
  async function fetchData() {
      try {
          const response = await $.ajax({ ... });
          return response;
      } catch (error) {
          console.error("AJAX call took a nap:", error);
      }
  }
  ```
- **jQuery**: Stick to jQuery for DOM manipulation (it‚Äôs in `script.js`). Avoid vanilla JS unless necessary.
- **Error Handling**: Catch errors and show user-friendly alerts.
  ```javascript
  $.ajax({
      error: () => alert("Oops, the server‚Äôs throwing a tantrum!")
  });
  ```

### HTML/CSS (index.html, styles.css) üé®
Our dashboard‚Äôs UI is prettier than a churn-free revenue report, so keep the HTML and CSS clean and accessible.

- **HTML**:
  - Use lowercase tags and attributes: `<div class="hero-section">`, not `<DIV CLASS="HERO">`.
  - Semantic tags: `<section>`, `<nav>`, not just `<div>` soup.
  - Accessibility: Add ARIA labels for interactive elements.
    ```html
    <button aria-label="Toggle chatbot">Chat</button>
    ```
  - Indentation: 2 spaces, align attributes for readability.
    ```html
    <div class="card" id="insights">
        <h2>Insights</h2>
    </div>
    ```
- **CSS**:
  - Use custom properties: Stick to `--primary-color`, `--accent-color`, etc., from `styles.css`.
  - Organize with comments:
    ```css
    /* Hero Section */
    .hero-section {
        background: var(--primary-color);
    }
    ```
  - Class Names: Kebab-case (e.g., `.chat-message`). No IDs for styling.
  - Indentation: 2 spaces. Group related rules.
  - Media Queries: Group at the end of the file.
    ```css
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
        .sidebar { display: none; }
    }
    ```
  - Avoid `!important`. If you need it, you‚Äôre probably doing something wrong.

### General Rules üåê
These apply to everyone, because we‚Äôre all in this churn-fighting boat together.

- **File Naming**: Kebab-case for files (e.g., `my-new-chart.js`). No spaces or uppercase.
- **Testing**: Test with `Sample_dataset1.csv` before committing. Ensure charts load and the chatbot doesn‚Äôt crash.
- **Dependencies**: Update `requirements.txt` for new Python packages. Avoid adding unused libraries (looking at you, `gunicorn`).
  ```text
  pandas==2.0.3
  ```
- **Commits**: Small, focused commits with clear messages.
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Fix chatbot crash on empty input"
  ```
- **Logging**: Use `app.log` for Python errors. Console.log for JavaScript debugging, but remove before committing.
- **No Breaking Changes**: Don‚Äôt mess with the chatbot‚Äôs soul or the dashboard‚Äôs dark theme. We‚Äôre attached.
- **Optional Linters**:
  - Python: Run `pylint app.py` or `flake8` for PEP 8 compliance.
  - JavaScript: Use `eslint` with `camelcase` and `indent` rules.
  - CSS: Try `stylelint` for consistent formatting.
  - Not mandatory, but they‚Äôll make your code extra shiny.

Got it? Now go write code that makes our dashboard proud. If you don‚Äôt, we‚Äôll send the chatbot to haunt your dreams with churn stats. üòú
